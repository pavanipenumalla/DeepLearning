Deep Learning Assignments
==========================

## Assignment 1
- Implemented Gradient Descent and its variants (Polyak's Momentum, Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient, Adam Optimizer) from scratch.
- Implemented Backpropogation, RProp and QuickProp from scratch.

## Assignment 2
- Implemented RNN and LSTM using pytorch.
- Trained an encoder-decoder model to learn a trasformation which takes a sentence and outputs a transformed sentence.

## Assignment 3
- Worked with transformers, encoder-decoder models and denoising autoencoders.

## Assignment 4
- Worked with GANs and Diffusion Models.
